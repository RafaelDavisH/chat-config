  <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Before you begin, we ask that you take 2 minutes to read our <a href="https://code-of-conduct.freecodecamp.org/"
      target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a> which we enforce strictly across our community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we have a couple of rules specific for the Chat server:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: justify; margin: 2% 2%">
    <p> 1. Large blocks of code can be disruptive to the flow of chat. If you want to share more than a few lines, use a
      service like Pastebin or GitHub Gists and share the link instead.</p>
    <p> 2. Please refrain from uploading files directly (especially code files) for the safety of our users.</p>
    <p> 3. Discussions should be kept in the appropriate channels.</p>
    <p> 4. Please do not use the everyone or here mentions.</p>
    <p> 5. Please refrain from sharing links to social media accounts, blog posts, or YouTube videos as this is
      considered
      (self-)promotion. GitHub accounts and development projects for review (such as a Tribute Page) are acceptable.
    </p>
    <p> 6. Please refrain from discussing drugs, alcohol, or other content that may not be appropriate for our users
      under
      the age of 18.</p>
